As well as total time controls, there is also something known as 'increment'. Increment is a certain amount of time that is added onto each player's time once their turn is ended. For example, if a game was started with a two minute time control and a fifteen second increment and the first player took five seconds to move, they would have two minutes - five seconds + fifteen seconds increment = two minutes and five seconds left on their clock.
